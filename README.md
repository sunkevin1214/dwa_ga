In the orginal paper of dynamic weight aggregation method, the author claimed that evolutionary strategy should be used for solving this problem. However, based on my own implementation and analysis that such an implementation can not solve the complex benchmark problems, especifically in the event of problems with many local-optimal.

I implement the same idea based on ga and found it worked very well.
